### Database Relationships

```
User (Django built-in)
â”œâ”€â”€ UserProfile (OneToOne)
â”œâ”€â”€ Course (as instructor)
â”œâ”€â”€ Enrollment (as student)
â””â”€â”€ Progress (as student)

Course
â”œâ”€â”€ Enrollment (students)
â”œâ”€â”€ Lesson (course content)
â””â”€â”€ Progress (via lessons)

Lesson
â””â”€â”€ Progress (student completion)
```

## Next Steps

### To use these models:

1. **Create and run migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. **Create a superuser**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

3. **Test in admin interface**:
   - Access `/admin/`
   - Create user profiles with different roles
   - Create courses and lessons
   - Test enrollments

### Phase 2 Tasks (Next):
- Update views to use Course model instead of Post
- Create course listing and detail views
- Implement enrollment functionality
- Update templates for course display
