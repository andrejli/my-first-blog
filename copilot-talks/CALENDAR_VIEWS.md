# Date range calculation per view mode
if view_mode == 'week':
    weekday = current_date.weekday()  # Monday = 0
    start_date = current_date - timedelta(days=weekday)
    end_date = start_date + timedelta(days=6)
elif view_mode == 'day':
    start_date = current_date
    end_date = current_date
```
